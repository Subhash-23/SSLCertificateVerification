JMETER
Apache JMeter is an open-source software designed to perform load testing, performance testing, and functional testing on web applications. It is a testing tool used to simulate heavy load on network server to test its strength and analyze overall performance under various loads.  The main purpose of using this testing tool is to measure the performance of the application as we would've already used tools like junit, mockito to test its functionality.

KEYFEATURES:
	Performance Measurement under different loads
	Wide range of protocol support
	Extensible support
	User-Friendly GUI
	Distributed load measurement

COMPONENTS OF JMETER:
TestPlan - Blueprint or overall schedule
ThreadGroup - virtual user/group of simulated users
LogicController - controls the flow
Assertion - criteria to check whether the tests  are passed
Timer - time delays
Sampler - sending the request
Listeners - capturing the result
Configuration Elements - predefined data like credentials
Pre/Post Controllers - modifying before or after the sampler execution
